# To reproduce in VSCode:

- load this repo,
- use "Undo last commit..." action

## Expected result:
show diff of the last commit, be able to commit with the button

## Actual result:
empty diff shows; if there's been other commits pushed,
you see "Push changes" button instead of "Commit"; otherwise,
"Commit" button is disabled
